<h1>Therese Corrigan's Basic Webpage</h1>

<h2>My first idea is a business webpage</h2>

<p>The webpage created would be for a local, small owned, business. The webpage would include pictures, postings of local events attending, and links that help customer move about the product pages.<br>
Below is a sampling.</p>

<h2 style="background-color: #000066; color: #ffffff;">A Bit of Heaven and Earth LLC</h2>

<h3 style="font-size: 20px;">Specializing in:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Mystical, Magickal, and Practical Gifts</li>
 	<li>Customized Embroidery Items</li>
	<li>Various Sundries</li>
</ul>

<h2>Second idea, topic, would be a blog page.</h2>

<p>The blog page would log the trials and tribulations of owning a "Fixer Upper House”, including “Before and After” pictures, and provide links to helpful websites such as <a href="http://thisoldhouse.com">thisoldhouse.com</a>. This Old House website is great, in fact as they say:</p>

<p>I have to say, that I now having an understanding of what it entails to create a webpage; I have a great deal of respect for those who design Web pages!  The time and attention to detail are incredible.  Just one tag or mislabeled element can make a world of difference.</p>
