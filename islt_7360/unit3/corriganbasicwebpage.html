<h1>Therese Corrigan's Basic Webpage</h1>

<h3>My first idea is a business webpage</h3>

<p>The webpage created would be for a local, small owned, business. The webpage would include pictures, postings of local events attending, and links that help customer move about the product pages.<br>
Below is a sampling.</p>

<h2 style="background-color: #000066; color: #ffffff;">A Bit of Heaven and Earth LLC</h2>

<blockquote cite="Onwer of A Bit of Hheaven and Earth LLC"><h3>
	Specializing in:
<ul>
	<li>Mystical, Magickal, and Practical Gifts</li>
 	<li>Customized Embroidery Items</li>
	<li>Various Sundries</li>
</ul></blockquote></h3>

<br>
<h3>Second idea, would be a blog page.</h3>

<p>The blog page would log the trials and tribulations of owning a "Fixer Upper House”, including “Before and After” pictures, and provide links to helpful websites such as <a href="https://thisoldhouse.com"/>https//thisoldhouse.com</a></p>
