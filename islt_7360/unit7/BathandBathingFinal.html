<h1>Bath &amp; Bathing</h1>

<p>When thinking of soaking in the bathtub, I envision gentle music playing in the background; lights dimmed with a candle or more providing a soft glow about the room, maybe a glass of wine, and stepping into the soothing tub water, that is just the right temperature.  Pure bliss.  You can choose from scented bath oils, bath salts, herbal bath teas, milk-based bath soaks &#40;some with foaming action&#41;, bath melts, or bath bombs with gentle fizzing action.  My goal with these <i>Bath &amp; Bathing</i> products is to create and enhance your bathing pleasure.</p>

<p><strong>Please Note:</strong> We prefer to use glassware with our products verse plastic for several reasons; our primary reasoning is because many essential oils can corrode plastic containers. Secondly, I like to,when able, use novelty glassware and containers.  This is especially true regarding the various holidays, seasons, and special occasions. Lastly, our reason for glassware is it just presents a more classic look and feel to our products.</p>
