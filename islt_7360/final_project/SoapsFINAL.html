 <h1>Soaps</h1>
    <p style="font-size:26px;">Soaps…are necessary and something you have to use to clean the body.  However, at A Bit of Heaven and Earth LLC, we would like you to think of soap differently.  We encourage you to enjoy using the soap itself.  This form of enjoyment could come from the luscious lathering, the gentle aroma, or the fun shape of the soap that brings a smile to your face. Another unique feature about our soaps is when able, we attempt to use vintage dishes or nontraditional items &#40;such as glass coasters, glass trays, and even clay flower pot saucers to name a few &#41; as soap dishes.</p>

    <p style="font-size:26px;">We make every attempt at the creation of our soaps to be free of unwanted chemicals and detergents. Choosing to use ingredents such as Phthalate Free fragrances, essential oils, herbs, flowers, micas and herbal infused oils &#40;for colorants&#41;.  Our soaps also use a special combination of oils that are incorporated to creating the <i>Luscious Lathers</i> that last to the end of the soap’s life.  Depending on the time of year, some oils are changed to combat the risk of over drying the skin.  We are happy to create that singular soap for those with special skin issues.</p>  

<h2>Types of Soaps Available:</h2>
<ul style="font-size: 22px;
	font-weight: bold;">
	<li>Bar Style</li>
	<li>Novelty Shapes</li>
	<li>Guest Size</li> 
  <li>Liquid</li>
	<li>Whipped Sugar Scrub</li>
</ul> 

  <h2>Bar Style Soaps</h2>
  <p style="font-size:24px;">Bar Style soaps are just that, they are molded into a loaf and then cut into sections.  We use this style predominately for creating layers and scenes with our soaps. These are priced at &#36;1.10 per weight ounce. Some examples are pictured below:</p>

  <h2>Guest Sized Soaps</h2>
  <p style="font-size:24px;">Guest Sized soaps are small individual hand sized soaps and are perfect for everyday hand washing.  We like to create various soaps shaped with molds, that will be suitable for various holidays, special occasions, and themes.  These guest sized soaps can be the perfect way to spruce up any bathroom and also provide that just perfect gift or enhance that special occasion.  One of my favorite Hostess gifts is to pair themed guest sized soaps with one of our embroidered hand &#40;guest&#41; towels.  We have a large variety of soap molds available, that can be matched to create the special touch for you or someone else.  Our Guest Sized soaps are available in sets of 3 to 6 each. Below is a fraction of what we can make in the way of shaped guest sized soaps.</p>

  <h2>Novelty Shapes</h2>
  <p style="font-size:24px;">Novelty Shaped soaps are one of our top favorites to make.  Whether making soap shapes to match the season, holiday, party theme or special occasion; we like making ordinary soaps, extraordinary.  This principle applies even to our unscented soaps.  We understand many need unscented soaps for various reasons but, that does not mean the soap has to be boring!  One creative way we have applied is embedding an embroidered design into the soap.  The design is sewn onto tulle and layered within the soap.  As the soap wears down the embroidered design will eventually come off, at which point just throw the tulle with the design away.  Like our guest sized soaps; we have a large variety of soap molds available, that can be matched to create the special touch for you or someone else. These are priced at &#36;1.10 per weight ounce. Below are a few samples of such.</p>

</figure>

  <h2>Liquid Soaps</h2>
  <p style="font-size:24px;">Liquid soaps are great for the bathroom and kitchen for daily hand washing. You will note that like our Bath &amp; Bathing product line, we prefer to use glassware with our products verse plastic for several reasons; our primary reasoning is because many essential oils can corrode plastic containers. Secondly, I like to use, when able, novelty glassware, and containers.  This is especially true regarding the various holidays, seasons, and special occasions. Lastly, our reason for glassware is it just presents a more classic look and feel to our products. Liquid soaps are available in 8 ounce jars and are priced at &#36;9.95 each.</p>

</figure>

<h2>Whipped Sugar Scrub Soap</h2>
<p style="font-size:24px;">Whipped Sugar Scrub soaps are formulated to the consistently of that like Marshmallow cream.  To clarify, however, is it <strong>not</strong> for human consumption.  What makes our whipped sugar scrub, so special?  It is the sugar.  Instead of using salt as an exfoliant, we prefer sugar.  It is less abrasive but just as effective and if you have any open areas in the skin, well… let us just say, “<i>no rubbing salt in the wound</i>”!  For the same reasons as noted with our liquid soaps and Bath &amp; Bathing product line, we prefer to use glassware with this product as well. Whipped sugar scrubs are available in 4-ounce jars, priced at &#36;9.95 each and 8-ounce sized jars, priced at &#36;12.95 each.</p>
