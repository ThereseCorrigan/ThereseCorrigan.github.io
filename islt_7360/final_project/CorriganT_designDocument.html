<h1>Therese’s Design Document</h1>

<h2>Purpose:</h2>
<p>This website will be for a small; local business called <i style="font-size: 125%;">A Bit of Heaven and Earth</i>.  The goal is to help the business expand not only within the current consumer market of direct sales from those attending local craft fair/events, but to provide the opportunity for invitations to other craft fair/events, and to reach the consumer market by way of the World Wide Web’s eCommerce.</p>  

<h2>Use Cases:</h2>

<p>The Website would provide a calendar of craft fairs/events the business will be attending so local consumers can see firsthand (although limited) a sampling of items offered and speak directly with the owner.  Craft fair/event consumers that do not wish to purchase at present or from what is currently available have the flexibility to go to the website, preview all items available and make purchases.  Organizers of craft fairs/events searching for crafters can review site and invite business to attend their particular craft fair/event as well as, post business on a major Fair/Event website that can be accessed by people looking for something to do.</p> 


<h2>Data Collection - Questions from and to consumers:</h2>
<p>
<i><strong>Do you have a website where I can see more of the things you make?</strong></i> 
<p>This question was asked at least once during every craft fair/event attended, which was one of the reasons it was decided to develop a website.  The other reason was that during the craft fair/events only allowed for a small sampling of what had and could offer in the way of products.</p>

<i><strong>What is it about the products offered by A Bit of Heaven and Earth that have you buying here verse elsewhere?</strong></i>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc">	
	<li>Handmade</li>
	<li>Beautiful packaging and labeling</li>
	<li> Clear list of ingredients – know what exactly getting, 
 	Items are not seen every day, unique</li>
</ul>

<i><strong>Do you take custom orders?</strong></i>
<p>Often customers will ask about custom orders regarding specific scents, colors, for a special event, and or design for that someone special.  This question also can be used as a design tool when creating a website by showing examples of products offered in other scents, colors, etc.</p> 

<i><strong>How would you like to see items displayed on the website?</strong></i>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc">
 	<li>Pictures large enough to see details and from various angles</li>
 	<li>Include descriptions, care of, warnings, and how to use</li>
 	<li>Ideas and pictures of gift set combinations</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>Design Concept:</h2>

<h3>1. Audience:</h3>
<p>The target audience is to not only capture local consumers that have or can attend craft fairs/events but entice repeat consumers the flexibility of purchasing an item year-round and without having to leave their home. Attract the attention of Organizers of craft fairs/events seeking crafters to help draw in fair attendees, reach individuals searching for fairs/events for “things to do” in the area, as well as those who are web searching for unique, handmade, items made with a personal touch.  The age of audience will vary depending on where consumer originates from.  The majority of consumers that attend the craft fair/events range from teenagers to adults and mostly female. Those whom would be making purchases from the websites would have to be of at least 18 years or older; the site will have products that will appeal to both genders.</p> 

<h3>2. Reference websites:</h3>

<h3>3. Wireframe of Website Organization:</h3>
<p><a href="https://ThereseCorrigan.github.io/islt_7360/final_project/wireframe.docx"> Wireframe for webpage.</a></p>

<h3>4. The Rationale for Organization:</h3>
<p>I chose a horizontal placement of with the thought that, the eyes would move left right and down the page; as would when reading a book.  The use of pictures will help focus the eye on the category and prompt the consumer to look further.  When select one of the Navigation tabs under Shop by Category you will be taken to that page. Once on the page the page, one will see all items related to, including various pictures with the ability to zoom in or select various angles, ingredients, directions, price, and number in stock. This helpful as the consumer will be informed of what they are getting before buying and more likely to increase customer satisfaction about the product.</p>

<h3>5. Media:</h3>
<p>I will be using pictures taken by the owner and those sent by consumers with permission to use.  I believe pictures are important to give the descriptions of the products more meaning.  Also, by including pictures of the business setup at local craft fair/events will help potential fairgoers recognizing the site or entice them to check it out.</p>

<h3>6. Color Scheme and Rationale:</h3>
<p>Colors help enhance, stimulate, moods and emotions.  By using colors can help set the mood/tone of the website.  I will be attentive to the colors chosen regarding how they will be displayed on other monitors (web safe colors) and how would look to a consumer that is color blind.  The color of my fonts and the size will also be important so that older consumers can easily read the text.  As I have noted, some webpage color combos make it difficult to read.<br>
Colors I will be using:</p>

<dl>
	<dt><span style="color: #33cc33;">Green</span></dt>
	<dd>- often suggests nature, natural and less likey to clash with pictures.</dt>

	<dt><span style="color: #0000FF;">Blue</span></dt> 
	<dd>– suggests calm and serenity, often listed as a favorite color, especially by men since trying to appeal to both genders</dd>

	<dt><span style="color: #ff9900;">Orange</span></dt>
	<dd>– suggests warmth and energetic, catches the eye draws your attention</dd>

	<dt><span style="color: #ff66ff;">Pink</span></dt>
	<dd>– soft, romantic, feminine, universal love</dd>
