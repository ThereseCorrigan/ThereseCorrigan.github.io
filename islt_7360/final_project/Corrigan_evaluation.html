<h1>Evaluator Participants</h1>

	<p>Robert “Rob,” a coworker, is 50 years old and is finishing up his Bachelor's degree in Information Security; which has required him to learn several types and methods of coding, creating web pages and websites. He has graciously been mentoring me during this class and has been a great help. Since he is the only one in my area (luckily) that understands coding, I asked that he scrutinize the coding foremost; then look at everything else on my website.   I did not have the opportunity to observe Rob navigating about my website, but he gave me both detailed written and verbal feedback.   The computer he used was an HP 15 Notebook PC-AMD A6, 5200APU, Radeon HD 2.00HZ, 4GB RAM, 64 Bit.  The Browser was Google Chrome via public WiFi.</p>

	<p>Elise, 61 years old, is a current purchaser of products as well as having requested custom orders. She has no coding experience therefore not able to review coding; she is one of my observed users.  I was able to watch her use the site; which was a good thing, as she thought it was only one page and did not realize how to navigate the <strong>“Navigation Bar”</strong> to view the other pages.  The computer she used was a Dell computer, Intel&#174; Core&#8482; (i7-6700 CPO @ 3.40GHz). The Browser she used was Internet Explorer 10.0, via a corporate Internet connection.</p>

	<p>Kim, 54 years old, is an owner of an online Medical Supply Company and also is a Promoter for her local Church’s Craft Fairs and Events.  A web design company developed her business website; she does not have any coding experience, but I was also able to observe her navigating about my website.  The computer she used was a, HP Pavilion x360 running Windows 10, Intel Core i5-7200 @ 2.5 GHz, 8GB RAM, and the Browser used was Google Chrome.</p>

<h1>Summary of Evaluator's Comments</h1>

	<p>The evaluators that provided only a few comments (Elise &amp; Kim), I was able to ask verbal questions while observing them using the site.   All the evaluators predominantly mark 4 and 5’s under the <i>Design</i> section of the evaluation form.  They liked the color choices, font size, and the images.  This was critical as Elise has vision issues but, verbalized no issues with reading the text.   Regarding the content of my site, all verbally agreed that they found the information and details provided by the company and products very informative and enjoyed reading.  However, despite positive verbal comments, Kim gave me 1’s with the written comment of “to the word” and “too deep” in regards to the information being too in depth.  She clarified this by telling me that when she was having her website developed by developers, they had made similar comments about the detailed information she was providing.  Thus, going on this premise, she applied this same principle to my site.  The one things she did not care at all, was the wording “World Wide Web” as part of my <i>Check out our other locations on the World Wide Web</i>.   Rob gave high praise for my coding.  He especially likes the use of CSS in my “style” element and went on to praise what he called the use of “good programming practice.”   None of the evaluators had any issues with navigation about my website or viewing the images on their various computer systems.  In fact, Rob commented, “little to no latency in image loading”.  None of the evaluators had any major issues, concerns or comments about the site.</p>

		<h2>User Cases</h2>

		<p>I am happy I was able to address all the user cases in my current website. The site was to help a small, local business step out into the eCommerce and reach a broader set of potential customers. I was able to add the <strong>Calendar of Events</strong> section with links to the upcoming events where the business will be next.  The site appeals to my current customers and has enticed another, once he had a chance to review the site.  In fact, he commented that “now interested in trying out some of your herbal soaps.”  My friend who is a Promoter for Craft Fairs and Events of her local church verbally commented that she liked the photos of products and felt the packaging (as seen in the photos) added an element of quality.  If this were to be an actual, active, website, I would also make sure that the business was also posted in the listed in the links of Esty and the Fairs and Festivals, Virginia site. Of the things I did not get done, was the other products pages, these would have represented more accurately, the various items the business has to offer.  Although I had descriptions and some pictures, verse completely blank, they were not completed due to the lack of time that was required to build these pages in their entirety.</p>

		<p>Rob was my HTML5 evaluator for the project.  However, I also would classify him as a potential consumer, as never having known about the business.  By reviewing the site as a new potential customer was a bonus.</p>

		<p>Elise is a current consumer, who now can purchase already made or order custom-made products at any time.</p>

		<p>I asked Kim to review the website as a Promoter, looking for crafters as she does for her local church.  She is also a current customer, who have purchased ready-made and also custom orders.</p>
	
<h1>Recommended&#47;Planned Changes to the Design</h1>

	<p>The majority of the changes I plan to make will be based on the recommendations by Rob’s advise and comments.  I will be adding a <strong>Return to the Top</strong> tab.  As he mentioned and I agree as the pages get longer, with new products added, it will be convenient to have the button verse having one depending on the scroll bar.  I find this a nuisance when on other sites, therefore do not want viewers to feel the same with my website.</p>

	<p>The idea of placing a <strong>Return Home</strong> link at the bottom of the pages, falls along the same lines as the <strong>Return to the Top</strong> tab.</p>

	<p>Adding the ability “zoom” pictures and provide, when able, photos of products at different angles; adds a visual, interactive, component to the pages.</p>

	<p>Review and address the email link, under the <strong>Contact Us</strong> page.  This is important for customers to be able to reach the owner regarding questions, placing special orders, and other topics.  If cannot reach someone, often credibility of site goes down.</p>

	<p>The one thing I will need to review and research before making any changes is in regards to the comments that the website is “too wordy,” the pages are too in-depth with information.  This was noted, based on a different type of company website and from said developers, to that owner.  This individual verbalized that she like my information but, due to her prior experience, based that standard to my website.  Since my website is different, I believe the additional information is both very helpful and informative; it is part of what helps make the site.</p>

<h1>Reflections of My Evaluation Process</h1>

	<p>I found it very interesting how two of the three people I selected to evaluate my website, would do as I would have before taking this course. That is looking at few things and determine whether I liked the site or not.  I now realize there is much more to developing a website and its pages then meet the eye.  Also seeing how the two evaluators, which reflects the way most people look at websites, I can appreciate the importance to grab the persons attention and hold, entice them to explore the website and pages further.  Rob having the experience on this subject was much more detailed originated in his review.  This is a good learning a tool, for when I started developing my website, my goal was to try and avoid the issues or what I perceived as annoyances encountered in other websites.   I was worried about font size being readable for most viewers and thought the picture sizes were going to be too big.  All three evaluators liked the readability of the font and no issues with picture size as displayed on their various computer screens.  In general, I was pleased how well the website was received, as looking at some of my classmate's sites, was concerned that maybe my site was a bit primitive, lacking a professional looking website.</p>
