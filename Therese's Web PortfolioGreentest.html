   <h2>Who is Therese M. Corrigan?</h2>

    <p style="font-size:18px;">There are many facets to who I am.  I am a veteran, that served 26 years in the United States Navy, as a Hospital Corpsman, achieving the rank of Hospital Corpsman Senior Chief (HMCS).  In 1993, became a registered nurse, graduating with an Associate degree and then in 1998 completed my Bachelors in Nursing.  At the beginning of 2017, I became an Operational Medical Instructor for the State Department. I am a graduate student attending the Masterâ€™s Online Degree Program in Information Science and Learning Technologies and Design with an emphasis in Educational Technology, as well as a graduate Certification as an Online Educator.</p>

    <p style="font-size:18px;">Throughout my various careers, there has always been a common thread.  I have always been drawn to teaching as well as, creating, developing, designing, and presenting educational materials to a diverse group of audiences/students/individuals.  To me, knowledge truly is power!  My goal has always been to empower those I am teaching.  Whether I updated and conducted an educational course for junior Hospital Corpsman in necessary medical skills, provided medical care instructions to both parent and child, co-created an educational pamphlet for waiting families of Cardiovascular Laboratory (CATH LAB) patients, or instructed personnel in life-saving skills.  It is at this point in my life, I found myself once again a student.  Upon my completion of this program with my skills and abilities fine-tuned, I will be enabled to pursue my dream to not only be a designer of instructional & educational materials but conduct the teaching as well.</p>
